# Additional Data

This directory contains several files that are part of this repositories inputs and outputs. This README outlies the contents of each of the files and describes each component.

## `pdb_identifiers.csv`
This file was created by user (`cnobles`) by taking the antibody names found in the `../manuscript_data/supp_tbl_6-antibody_naming_format.csv` and searching the PDB for structures associated with the antibodies. The search engine often returned non-specific files, so the search required the full antibody name or alias as well as an added search context of "SARS-CoV-2". There were 21 structures identified, though not all were crystalized with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Each structure was downloaded and the header information was reviewed for each to mark which chains within the models were associated with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (primary) or variable antibody chains or pepetides (secondary). `Short_Name` is a convention that helps map the Antibody to the data present in the manuscript supplemental data.

Columns:
* **Antibody**: Conventional name for the antibody, though aliases likely exist.
* **Short_Name**: Name used in the manuscript data for keeping track of the antibody or peptide.
* **PDB_id**: PDB identifier for the structure in the database.
* **Primary_Chains**: Model chains associated with the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein RBD.
* **Secondary_Chains**: Model chains associated to the antibody or peptide.

## `interacting_atoms.csv`
This file is generated by the `../identify_interacting_residues.ipynb` Jupyter notebook and contains all atoms within 4 Angstroms between primary and secondary chains, otherwise interpreted as molecularly interacting atoms. The file notes the atom associated with the primary chain, its residue, coordinates with respect to the structure, and the interacting secondary chain atom. These data are summarised to give the next file `interacting_residues.csv`.

Columns:
* **Antibody**: Conventional name for the antibody, though aliases likely exist.
* **Short_Name**: Name used in the manuscript data for keeping track of the antibody or peptide.
* **PDB_id**: PDB identifier for the structure in the database.
* **Primary_Chains**: Model chains associated with the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein RBD.
* **Secondary_Chains**: Model chains associated to the antibody or peptide.
* **chain**: Primary chain identifier for the interacting atom.
* **residnum**: Primary chains residue number, giving the position in the chain sequence.
* **resid**: Primary chain residue, single amino acid code.
* **atom**: Primary chain residue atom involved in the interaction (within 4A of secondary atom), identifier given in PDB format for atom notation.
* **coord_(xyz)**: XYZ coordinate space coordinate of the primary interacting atom within the structure.
* **int_chain**: Secondary chain identifier for the interacting atom.
* **int_residnum**: Secondary chain residual number, giving the position in the chain sequence.
* **int_resid**: Secondary chain residue, single amino acid code.
* **int_atom**: Secondary chain residue atom involved in the interaction (within 4A of the primary atom), identifier given in PDB format for atom notation.
* **int_dist**: Distance between the interacting atoms.
* **int_coord_(xyz)**: XYZ coordinate space coordinate of the secondary interacting atom within the structure.
* **mid_coord_(xyz)**: XYZ coordinate space coordinate of the midpoint of the interation between the two atoms.

## `interacting_residues.csv`
This file is generated by the `../identify_interacting_residues.ipynb` Jupyter notebook and contains all residues with atoms within 4 Angstroms between primary and secondary chains. The file notes the primary residues, their location in the primary chain, coordinates of the CA atoms with respect to the structure, and the interacting residues from the secondary chain. This file is a summary from `interacting_atoms.csv`.

Columns:
* **Antibody**: Conventional name for the antibody, though aliases likely exist.
* **Short_Name**: Name used in the manuscript data for keeping track of the antibody or peptide.
* **PDB_id**: PDB identifier for the structure in the database.
* **Primary_Chains**: Model chains associated with the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein RBD.
* **Secondary_Chains**: Model chains associated to the antibody or peptide.
* **chain**: Primary chain identifier for the interacting atom.
* **residnum**: Primary chains residue number, giving the position in the chain sequence.
* **resid**: Primary chain residue, single amino acid code.
* **coord_(xyz)**: XYZ coordinate space coordinate of the primary interacting atom within the structure.
* **int_chain**: Secondary chain identifier for the interacting atom.
* **int_residnum**: Secondary chain residual number, giving the position in the chain sequence.
* **int_resid**: Secondary chain residue, single amino acid code.
* **int_dist**: Minimal distance between the interacting atoms of the primary and secondary residuals.
* **int_coord_(xyz)**: XYZ coordinate space coordinate of the secondary interacting atom within the structure.
* **CA_dist**: Distance between the alpha carbons of the interacting residuals.
* **CA_mid_coord_(xyz)**: XYZ coordinate space coordinate of the midpoint of the interation between the two atoms.
